<p class="_summary">I am into marketing 80% technical and 20% creative, which makes me a 100% growth hacker – the best wave of digital marketers thus far. My second side is full-stack marketing – a full-scale digital marketing work. With extensive experience in building a strong brand presence across all the digital media platforms with a sales funnel, I craft and implement successful digital marketing strategies. That will earn any startup, small and medium-sized businesses best on their ROI.</a><br><br>
        I'd single-handedly work on a brand's identity creation, build their digital presence across website, newsletter, social and search media, design a conversion funnel specific to the business needs, run paid marketing campaigns, and enhance their customer experience through ongoing optimization.<br><br>
I have worked with dozens of startups, small and medium-sized enterprises.
