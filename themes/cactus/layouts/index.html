    Most recently, I single-handedly achieved the double in ROI in four months as compared to the previous eight months period when the entity had three resources with the double number of years of experience.<br><br>
    I am into marketing 80% technical and 20% creative, which makes me a 100% <b>growth hacker</b> – the best wave of digital marketers thus far. My second side is <b>full-stack marketing</b> – a full-scale digital marketing work. With extensive experience in building a strong brand presence across all the digital media platforms with a sales funnel, I craft and implement successful digital marketing strategies. That will earn any startup, small and medium-sized businesses best on their ROI.</a><br><br>
        I'd single-handedly work on a brand's identity creation, build their digital presence across website, newsletter, social and search media, design a conversion funnel specific to the business needs, run paid marketing campaigns, and enhance their customer experience through ongoing optimization.<br><br>
I have <b>worked with</b> dozens of startups, small and medium-sized enterprises.
