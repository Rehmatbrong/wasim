  "articleBody" : [ "“I learned this during 22 years of  corporate experience, where I failed multiple times (and many times miserably)  I rose back to normalise my status with great efforts,  I wish all these studies were available back then,  but I had to learn the hard way. As a leader I already follow what’s in the video, but my advice to young leaders is to listen to it carefully and follow it, as it will save you a decade if not more.” - Umer Ghumman", "Transcript</H2>\n\n<P>I studied the effects of incivility on people. What is incivility? It’s disrespect or rudeness. It includes a lot of different behaviors, from mocking or belittling someone to teasing people in ways that sting to telling offensive jokes to texting in meetings. So we launched a study on the effects of incivility on performance on the bottom line, and what we found was eye-opening.<BR/>\nWe sent a survey to business school alumni working in all different organizations, and we asked them to write a few sentences about one experience where they were treated rudely, disrespectfully or insensitively, and to answer questions about how they reacted. One person told us about a boss that made insulting statements like, “That’s kindergartner’s work,” and another tore up someone’s work in front of the entire team.<BR/>\nAnd what we found is that incivility made people less motivated: 66 percent cut back work efforts, 80 percent lost time worrying about what happened, and 12 percent left their job." ]
