To begin with, I'd like to declare that I do not share any information with respect to my portfolio contained under non-disclosure agreements.<br>

What set me apart in the <b>crowd</b> is that I have trained myself to be a full stack marketer through hard work and my experience is also backed by well recognized certifications.<br>

Most recently I single handedly rebranded logos, websites, stationary and several other branding ingredients of eight national and multinational companies based out of Dubai in a period of three months, created viral content and received more than 25 thousand organic likes and 1 million views for a Facebook page in two weeks, helped twenty startups launch from scratch and grow online, and represented Product Hunt for their first time launch in Pakistan.
