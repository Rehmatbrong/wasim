![My First 20 Months In Dubai](/images/pp1.jpg)



I came to Dubai back in December 2017, the same month when I started my first job in 2013. It’s the same month when I came to planet earth in 1989. The last month of a year.<br>
Before coming to Dubai, I had dozens of fascinations about the city, it’s people and corporates offices, all the picky scenes we have seen in media.<br>
I can’t think of anyone except my mother, who really believed that I would get a suitable job in a month as I did. I added over a hundred recruiters, people from my profession, and entrepreneurs on LinkedIn and got a 1% percent response from them. Someone recommended me a link to an opening at Filli Café, I instantly applied. 2% of them didn’t like the idea of moving here for career search and recommend other countries such as Australia.<br>
As a full-stack marketer, someone who have learned all the stacks of marketing while working with companies on small budget and resources, I had the confidence of being unique in my talent and beat the other 99%. I still think that this is the edge I have over a huge number of professionals in the same field.<br>
I prepared two types of CVs, one for sales and second for digital marketing, and printed almost fifty copies of them.

## First six months: January — June:

At first, I sorted out platforms, tax-free zones, media, academic, internet city directories, startups incubators websites and Google search to find vacancies. Applied at over thirty different jobs each day, but didn’t visit offices to drop CVs — a method recommended by some. I started receiving interview calls in the first week, followed by the second week with an interview and verbal confirmation from one company who later didn’t agree to send a confirmation email saying that their CEO has denied issuing new visas. Before this, I had already denied attending the second interview with an advertising agency. I reach back to them again and they confirmed the second interview saying that I should wait for them for a week and don’t talk to anyone else. Later, I got a call, among others, from a reputable search engine optimization firm with a better package, but I refused to visit them.<br>
When I started my career, I wanted to work some brand guy, one thing I didn’t know was ambassadors are people with followers who are paid for their fame. The second choice I found was brand manager, see the word brand fascinates to my thoughts. I reach an article from Fast Company, after arriving in Dubai, that full-stack marketers are the new wave of branding professionals. And luckily, my first job in Dubai was a senior digital branding specialist at Vudu Advertising. Tada!<br>
After rebranding a group of five international business entities based out of Dubai within a short period of three months, I kicked off my work. In the second my joining, I pitched a workshop to Infive on the topic of full-stack marketing and they accepted. A secret, I pitched to several co-working spaces and incubation centers through email, Facebook and meetup.com. Someone from meetup.com recommended me to talk to Infive which was eventually helpful.

## Second six months: July — December:

I attended some career growth courses that I had seen in my early career, including generalassemb.ly digital marketing circuit, growthmaster taught by Sean Ellis, and reshaped by portfolio on my personal website wasim.co. I was gearing up for further growth. And, it’s in accordance with my experience, don’t ever stop improving.<br>
In October 2018, I got my first interview call from an online insurance comparison website BuyAnyInsurance.com for the position of search engine optimization expert. After the interview, I informed the company what they really needed was a growth hacker who can manage to grow their users with least or zero amount of budget. The startup asked me to send them a plan, which I was afraid to share — yet it’s also sometimes said to be fine.<br>
During these months, I visited Doha and met with an old friend to run an agency together and attended startupschool.org under my hobby projects, pbq.ai, and pbq.io.<br>
As I visited back to my hometown, I helped maddy.pk to rebrand and get incubated.

## Third six months: January — June:

As I had heard fi.co as one of the world’s leading startups accelerator. After failing to succeed in pitching them back in my home town, I re-approached them and it went successful. I contacted somebody who I met at startupschool, and discussed the idea. He accepted the invitation and we continued to talk to the launch team.<br>
A hustler never stops, so far I have tried and tested eight different business ideas. I still remember I talked to someone in the final years at Oxford, he said that he was working on ten different business ideas — inspired me to be a hustler.<br>
I was invited by BuyAnyInsurance.com once again, in April, and this time they briefed me with the situation and the challenging that they were facing, thoroughly. I was invited to be a part of their team as a growth hacker. This job title was the second fascination since the first time I heard about it. I felt that I was inevitably going to be a part of their team for the first time I walked into this office and there was no better compatible for this role, to show resilience on challenges.<br>
I replaced the three ten to fifteen years experienced professionals, in the roles of strategic marketing, paid media and communications design, within the first two months of my joining, cutting down the marketing spend to the bare minimum. While we started spending more on strengthening sales funnel by getting new software to improve customer experience and automate customer touchpoints. I being the first to introduce Chabot for buying and staying up to date with insurance in UAE. In the first month on paid media, I optimized for the weak areas and cut down the spend to 80% while improved the results to 105%.<br>
To learn and explore the ideas, I buy books and surf the internet, I read the books off and on.

## Last two months: July — August:

In the last few months, I have been invited by a Danish businessman, ex-Vodafone and Etisalat director, a CEO at a Singapore based ventures capitalist firm, and some recruiters with their offers of sorts. To tell the truth, it makes sense to be available on professional networking websites. Launched two more hustlers’ hobby projects, sanity.ai, and hatti.me.<br>
Currently, I hold industry-recognized certifications and a proven record in digital media transformation and still fond of teaching others for zero fees through events and webinars with no sales or pushy content. To fill the pot, you have to empty it first, which is a brain in this case.
