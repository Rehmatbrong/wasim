Unlike what we see in the money machines more than email services, hey.com looks a promising product to solve a list of <a href="https://hey.com/problems-with-email/" target="_blank">25 issues</a> in your email inbox.<br>

## First Thing

Who does not want a clean life? Especially, after seeing the dangers of Covid-19. Lol.<br>

Your brain needs a relaxed environment, dedicated and focused space to work in.

## Secondly

The available options to communicate mails over the internet are either left orphan after their initial release, so there are no improvements in them, visually, features or otherwise. <br>

Or they have started making money that runis the experience.

## Let's Face It

Your emails inbox needs revamp, just like their subject line and body.
