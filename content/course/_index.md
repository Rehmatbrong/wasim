This course has been created for beginner and intermediate levels because this is what the majority needs at the moment. You are eligible if you can spend 3 hours per week, at the randomly announced days, due to my tight schedule I have to announce different days. Although, you can still get notes from fellow participants.<br>
We are going to discuss design, website, advertising, social, search, video, analytics, emails, and writing from idea stage and planning to execution and optimization stages. Do not worry, I have my portfolio in all of them and certificates too. See them <a href="https://wasim.co/work/">here</a>.<br>
The dates to start this course shall be announced later, though your emails or WhatsApp numbers.<br>
In order to ask me anything, please write me a formal email at wasim.ullah@aol.com.<br>
