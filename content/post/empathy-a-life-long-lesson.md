"I learned this during 22 years of  corporate experience, where I failed multiple times ( and many times miserably)  I rose back to normalise my status with great efforts,  I wish all these studies were available back then,  but I had to learn the hard way. As a leader I already follow what's in the video, but my advice to young leaders is to listen to it carefully and follow it, as it will save you a decade if not more." - Umer Ghumman
