A few weeks ago, I tried <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/" target="_blank">Netlify CMS</a> and <a href="https://forestry.io/" target="_blank">Forestry</a>, and here are the results.

## Speed
JAM stands for javascript, API, and markup. While serving over content delivery network (CDN) with deployment, they're blazing fast. You don't have to setup database or .htaccess files anymore.

## Simplicity
Forestry is built in elegant modern style. Both of them provide an extremely simple layout which is also good for non-tech-savvy bloggers.

## Security
They are run in HTML deployed using API over CDN protected by Let's Encrpt Authority, therefore security is all time high.
