Your business growth can be tedious process. After some minutes, when the tasks are repetitive in nature, we mostly feel bored and aggressive — to finish the repetitive tasks faster.

You no longer need a human support to do the same work over and over. These technologies in customer support, content sharing, article writing, and many more can help you relax your muscles.

When used in moderate environment, these technologies are flawless and handsome enough to inspire a large scale human growth.

## AI Writer

A free tool to write any article on any topic or rephrase those articles. You can also adjust the uniqueness for different sentences.

You can get reports on the content published on a specific topic or keywords. Receive a draft of those articles delivered containing useful information and ideas. Rewrite the article for multiple times to adjust the taste and quality.

Examples of this tool are how to write a good blog post? and how to determine the quality of wine?

While Spin Rewriter is another great tool using ENL Semantic Spinning Technology to automate writing articles.

## Many Chat

Ever wanted to engage your Facebook fan page audience on daily basis without having to send inbox messages to each and every one of them? This is possible through Manychat. After a user shows their consent to subscribe to your daily Facebook messages, they will receive a series of notifications and new feed from you.

Hubspot chatbot is second suitable option here.

## IFTTT

Ifttt helps your apps and devices work together in new ways. From your daily home chores, to special events, occasions, blog posts, your mobile phone functions to news information and even social media sharing without requiring complex coding knowledge. You can even edit the content shared from one platform to another, then leave it to automation — even when you’re sleeping — it’ll work on its own.

Microsoft Flow is yet another simpler platform to automate cross platform sharing process. <br>
