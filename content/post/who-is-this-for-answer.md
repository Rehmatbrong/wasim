![Buyer Persona](/images/buyer.jpg)

Your buyer persona is the heart of your business strategy and marketing campaigns. An ideal buyer has to be defined from every angle, including their personality traits, psychological and behavioral interests, daily routine, motivations, and more.<br>
A common perception is to have an ideal match between your current clients and the persona that you are going to create. On the contrary, you could just imagine somebody with a fake name, living somewhere, and write down their age, interests, and inspirations. After that, you can produce your blog posts style and content knowledge depth, visuals psychology, photography, and website structure according to that individual.<br>
When you will start optimizing your content for one individual, rest of the society with fully or partially similar traits will follow by default. However, your consistency can only be ensured if you have an ideal persona on mind before creating your brand identity, business strategy, and marketing campaigns.
