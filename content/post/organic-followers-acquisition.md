In 2017, I posted a short clip followed by similar other video clips.

## Thumbnail
As human pyschology can easily be attracted by the visuals, the video thumbnail was intentionally kept unique.

## Struggle
The 3:17 minutes long video is composed of humans working hard to earn their bread and butter.

## Food
Everyone has close attachment to food items, is also visible.

This video clips generated 25k organic fanbase in a period of two weeks.
