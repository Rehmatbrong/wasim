Have you heard of developer tools feature? If not, and you have to edit CSS or html, front end of your website can be edited with command + F. You can actually copy a piece of information you want to piece, and paste in developer tools find feature.<b>
Likewise, when it's about CSS, you will call an image an img, an image style can be tweaked with simple width, padding, and so on. And a complete website's colors, fonts, sizes, and front end can be edited with this simple feature.<br>
Lastly, a website's resolution is controlled by @media in CSS, so what you will type under a specific @media width, your relevant screen size will give the same output.
